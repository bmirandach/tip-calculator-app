## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

I'll talk about my first sass experience in Thoughts, so this space will be to talk about the icon inside the input. It wasn't until I started writing the js file that I realized the better way to add that dollar symbol to the bill input.
I want this burned in my memory.This is The Tip. I can't believe I was using a pseudo-element(::before) to add the icon and then modifying its position with media queries ü•¥

So... you leave your input alone:

```html
<input class="cool-bg" type="number" placeholder="0" autofocus />
```

And add the icon to the background with some 'padding' so it doesn't stay at the top left corner:

```css
.cool-bg {
  background: white url('images/icon.svg') no-repeat 15px 15px;
}
```

It doesn't have to be with a class, it can be with the id but..‚ú®classes‚ú®

### Thoughts and continued development

Sass. I've read that word so many times (always accompanied by compliments) that I decided to give it a try. I can see why all the things said are positive but I couldn't get the whole... experience?? I'm still not confident in my ability to name clases, that added to nesting... yeah, I knew I had to stop but wasn't sure when, what a mess.

The thing I felt more confident with were variables, sure the naming needs improvements but I felt good, it made the things I wrote look neater! that besides all the good things that come with variables of course.

I didn't get to use partials, mixins, extend or operators. I didn't try to. I found myself adding more divs after I thought I was done with that. I renamed classes just because the nesting was big... and so with new names I could start a new nest ouside the former one. I was trying to make my project more understandable for me, in a way that I can read what I wrote after waking up and get the idea. Adding more things to the mix when I wasn't comfortable with the things that were already there was a big no. Also I didn't want to stay stagnant because I didn't get the most out of it.
I can't point at this project and say 'hey look at this, look at my project with sass!! üòé ' with confidence. This is the first project I decided to try sass with. I hope to go back to this project in the future and notice how much I improved.

So... Sass. Need more practice.

JS was a nice break after all my doubts with sass. After a few twists and turns everything was working. There is no message for when the user inputs a negative or decimal number in the input of Number of People. So if the number is not an integer or higher than 0 the input will have the orage border and nothing else, just something I wanted to point out.
 
I'll do more projects, I'll keep practicing my naming ability (for classes and variables). Still have to refine my knowledge about flex and grid, when is one better than the other? And JS! I want more projects with javascript üëÄ
